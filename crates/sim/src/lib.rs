//! The Simulation: Flight Inputs, Radio Link, Assists, Flight Controller,
//! physics and session state.
//!
//! It is the only place where the physics and the Flight Controller meet.
//! Everything that can change a flight enters as Flight Inputs stamped with
//! Simulation Time.
//!
//! Empty for now: the tickets of the 0.1.0 alpha spec (#37) fill it in.
//!
//! # House rules
//!
//! This is a core crate: part of the Simulation, which gives bit-identical
//! results on every computer ([ADR-0001], [ADR-0003]). So it follows the house
//! rules:
//!
//! - Every maths function comes from `libm`, never from std's float methods
//!   such as `f64::sin` or `f64::powf`, which give different results on
//!   different platforms.
//! - No `HashMap` or `HashSet`: their order changes from run to run. Use
//!   `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet` or a `Vec`.
//! - No clock, no files, no Bevy and nothing else that touches the operating
//!   system.
//!
//! Clippy enforces the first two (and catches the usual clock and file calls)
//! with this crate's `clippy.toml`, which only the five core crates have.
//! `cargo xtask walls` checks the dependencies.
